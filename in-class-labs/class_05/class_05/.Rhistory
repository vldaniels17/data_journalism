# 65,359 rows (or observations or obs), 42 columns (or variables)
# The ZIP code columns could easily be stored as character data, because it would be silly to do math on them. Readr saw all digits in that column and guessed that we wanted it to be a number.  In fact, this probably created problems.  Look at the first record for REPORTER_ZIP. That's a distributor in Carlstadt, NJ.  The ZIP Code there is 07072.  But by storing it as a number, R cut off the first zero.  Later on, we'll get into how to tell R to read in certain columns as characters or numbers. Drug code is another example of something we don't need to do math on, so it probably should be stored as a character.
# Transaction Date is a good example of column that is stored as a character, but should really be stored as a date.  We'll learn how to do that in future assignments.
# Missing values appear to have been coded as the word "null".  In some cases, missing values will be stored as literally a missing value -- instead of "null" you'll have "".  More common is NA, which is a hidden character indicating a missing value.
